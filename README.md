# ITBootcamp Final Project
***
This is a test suite written in Java that is designed to automaticaly test [Conflux gaming club](https://conflux.rs/) web page elements and functionalities with Selenium and TestNG.<br><br>
> The test suite is desinged with Page Object Model (POM) concept.
> The Selenium data provider is used to fetch fictional user credentials from an Excel file.
> Tests are run using testNG with hard assert and special methods are used to test elements on the web page.
> Data is read by Apache POI library.<br><br>
> All the test classes in Java can be executed at once by running the *OneToRunThemAll.xml* file.<br><br>
> Note: I used ChromeDriver locally because we used it during classes, but I am aware of existance of WebDriverManager Java library.
